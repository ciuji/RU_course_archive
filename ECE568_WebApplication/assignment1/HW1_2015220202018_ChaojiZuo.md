## 4

### 4-a)

At first, the new price of row 111 would be 3 and the old price is 4, so it satisfies the requirment of triggle, then the trigger would be triggled and the updated price would be 3/2. But this all happened before the update process, so the price would be rewirte and since the purchaseID haven't change, the price wolud became 3. So the price of purchaseID 111 would be 3 at the end.

### 4-b)

The trigger would be triggled after the update process, so the price of 111 would be 1.5 at the end.

### 4-c)

INSTEAD OF means the original update process wolud be replace, so the price first became 3 and then trigger the trigger. So the price became 1.5 at last.
